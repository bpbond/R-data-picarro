A short workshop covering reproducibility and data management; data reshaping; and summarizing and manipulation.

Virginia Commonwealth University



http://rpubs.com/bpbond/r-data-vcu


The plan
========================================================

* Reproducible research and data management (~15 minutes)
* Filtering and reshaping data (~45 minutes; the `gapminder` dataset)
* Summarizing and manipulating data (~60 minutes; the `babynames` dataset)

Feedback: <a href="mailto:bondlamberty@pnnl">bondlamberty@pnnl.gov</a> or  [@BenBondLamberty](https://twitter.com/BenBondLamberty).


Requirements
========================================================

This workshop assumes an intermediate knowledge of R.

If you want to do the hands-on exercises (encouraged!), make sure up-to-date versions of the following packages are installed:
* `dplyr`
* `tidyr`
* `gapminder`
* `babynames`

Note the first two constitute a [particular and popular dialect of R](http://tidyverse.org), but the principles we'll go over are broadly applicable.


Reproducibility and data management
========================================================
type: section


Reproducibility
========================================================

We are in the era of collaborative 'big data', but even if you work by yourself with 'little data' you have to have some skills to deal with those data.

**Most fundamentally, your results have to be reproducible.**

>Your most important collaborator is your future self. It’s important to make a workflow that you can use time and time again, and even pass on to others in such a way that you don’t have to be there to walk them through it. [Source](http://berkeleysciencereview.com/reproducible-collaborative-data-science/)


Reproducibility
========================================================

Even if you don't buy it, **prepare yourself for the future**. Funders, journals, governments, colleagues are all pushing for more reproducibility and openness. It's a slow but steady ratchet.

NSF, DOE, Wellcome, Gates, etc. are increasingly requiring data management plans; data deposition; publication in open-access journals.

Reproducibility generally means *scripts* tied to *open source software* with effective *data management* and *archiving*.


You can't reproduce
========================================================

...what you've lost. What if you need access to a file as it existed 1, 10, or 100, or 1000 days ago?
- Incremental backups (minimum)
- Don't depend on yourself! Has to be _automatic_.
- Version control. A *repository* holds files and tracks changes: what, by whom, why

Version control
========================================================

**Git** (and website **GitHub**) are the most popular version control tools for use with R, and many other languages:
- version control
- sharing code with collaborators in a *repository*
- issue tracking
- public or private

***

<img src="images/git_2x.png" width="400" />


Data management during analysis
========================================================

Version control and scripts address two of the biggest problems with managing code and data: tracking *changes over time*, and understanding/reproducing *analytical steps*.

Ideally, _every_ step in your analysis is programmatic--done by a script--so it can be 'read': understood and reproduced later.


Reproducibility is a process
========================================================

*Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.* Upgrade and improve your workflow and skills over time.

>Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.

>But partially reproducible is better than not at all reproducible. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

Reproducible research example
========================================================

A typical project/paper directory for me, slightly idealized:
```
1-download.R
2-prepdata.R
3-analyze_data.R
4-manuscript_report.Rmd
logs/
output/
rawdata/
```

This directory contains *scripts* that are backed up both *locally* and *remotely*. It is under *version control*, so it's easy to track changes over time.

There's also [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), but that's a topic for another day.


Hands-on: setting up
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: false

If you're doing the exercises and problems, you'll need these
packages:
- `dplyr` - fast, flexible tool for working with data frames
- `tidyr` - reshaping and cleaning data
- `ggplot2` - popular package for visualizing data

We'll also use these data package:
- `babynames` - names provided to the SSA 1880-2013
- `gapminder` - life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for 142 countries


Reshaping datasets
========================================================

In honor of the late [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), we'll use the `gapminder` dataset today.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```


Pipelines
========================================================

The `magrittr` package (used by both `dplyr` and `tidyr`) provides the `%>%` operator, which allows us to _pipe_ an object forward into a function or call expression.

Note that `x %>% f` is _usually_ equivalent to `f(x)`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(gapminder)
gapminder %>% print
gagminder %>% head
gapminder %>% head(n=20)
gapminder %>% 
  print %>% 
  summary    # what is non-piped equivalent?
summary(print(gapminder))
```


dplyr
========================================================

The `dplyr` package uses _verbs_ (functions) to operate on _tibbles_ (data frames).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
some_data_frame %>% 

  do_something() %>%
  
  do_something_else() %>% 
  
  getting_dizzy_from_so_much_doing()
```

Let's go over some of those possible `do_something` steps.


filter
========================================================

Very commonly used.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Egypt")
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Egypt", year > 2000)
gapminder %>% filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "New Zealand", "Chad"))
```


filter
========================================================

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1977) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```


select
========================================================

Also extremely useful. Note different notations for selecting columns:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(gapminder, pop, year)
gapminder %>% select(pop, year)
gapminder %>% select(-lifeExp, -gdpPercap)
gapminder %>% select(-1)
```

There are lots of other cool ways to select columns--see `?select`.


Reshaping data
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: true

Let's focus on a single country's data for a bit. Write a pipeline that picks out Egypt data only, removes the continent and country columns, and assigns the result to a variable `Egypt`.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>% 
  select(-continent, -country) -> 
  Egypt
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Egypt
```


Reshaping data
========================================================

Put this into long (or _tidy_) format--where every row is a different observation. For this we use `tidyr::gather`, which asks: what's the data source? Name of variable column (i.e. that will get old names of columns)? Name of data column? And what columns to operate on?

```{r}
library(tidyr)
Egypt %>% gather(variable, value, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)
```


Reshaping data
========================================================

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
Egypt %>% 
  gather(variable, value, -year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, value)) + geom_line() +
   facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free")
```


Reshaping data
========================================================

Experiment. Why do these do what they do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Egypt %>% gather(variable, value, lifeExp)
Egypt %>% gather(variable, value, -lifeExp)
```

Why?


Reshaping data
========================================================

We can also spread our data out into a table form, like what you'd see in a spreadsheet, using `spread`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Egypt %>% 
  gather(variable, value, -year) %>% 
  spread(year, value)
```

`spread` is easy. It asks, 
* What goes across the new column names? 
* What's the data column to use?


Uniting, separating, mutating, and renaming
========================================================

These functions can be very useful.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% unite(coco, country, continent)
gapminder %>% 
  unite(coco, country, continent) %>% 
  separate(coco, 
           into = c("country", "continent"), 
           sep = "_", 
           extra = "merge")
gapminder %>% mutate(logpop = log(pop))
gapminder %>% rename(population = pop)
```


Summarizing data
========================================================
type: section


Summarizing and manipulating data
========================================================

Thinking back to the typical data pipeline, we often want to summarize data by groups as an intermediate or final step. For example, for each subgroup we might want to:

* Compute mean, max, min, etc. (`n`->1)
* Compute rolling mean and other window functions (`n`->`n`)
* Fit models and extract their parameters, goodness of fit, etc.

Specific examples:

* `gapminder`: what's the year of maximum GDP for each country?
* `babynames`: what's the most common name over time?


Split-apply-combine
========================================================

These are generally known as *split-apply-combine* problems.

From https://github.com/ramnathv/rblocks/issues/8


dplyr
========================================================

The `dplyr` package specializes in data frames, but also allows you to work with remote, out-of-memory databases, using exactly the same tools, because it abstracts away *how* your data is stored.

`dplyr` is very fast for most, though not all, operations on _data frames_ (tabular data).


Verbs
========================================================

`dplyr` provides functions for each basic *verb* of data manipulation. These tend to have analogues in base R, but use a consistent, compact syntax, and are high performance.

* `filter()` - subset rows; like `base::subset()`
* `arrange()` - reorder rows; like `order()`
* `select()` - select (or drop) columns
* `mutate()` - add new columns
* `summarise()` - like base R's `aggregate`


Why use dplyr?
========================================================

Why use `dplyr`?

* Clean, concise, and consistent syntax.
* High performance in most cases.
* Same code can work with data frames or remote databases.
* Very popular; lots of help/documentation

Why not?

* Package still changing--your code might 'break'
* Programming can be trickier in some circumstances
* Not as fast in certain cases
* The `data.table` package is also worth checking out for its speed.


Grouping
========================================================

`dplyr` verbs become particularly powerful when used in conjunction with *groups* we define in the dataset. This doesn't change the data but instead groups it, ready for the next operation we perform.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country)
```


Summarising
========================================================

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(maxpop = max(pop))
```


Summarising
========================================================

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(maxpop = max(pop))
```


Summarising
========================================================

We can apply a function to multiple columns, or multiple functions to a column (or both):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  select(-continent, -year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise_all(max)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, pop) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise_all(max)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, max)
```


Summarising
========================================================

We can build up a long pipeline to, e.g., summarise min, mean, max for all numeric variables and end up with a table with min-mean-max as columns headers, and variable (gdpPercap, lifeExp, pop) rows.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise_if(is.numeric, funs(min, max, mean)) %>% 
  gather(variable, value, -country) %>% 
  separate(variable, into = c("variable", "stat")) %>% 
  spread(stat, value)
```


Introducing `babynames`
========================================================

Explore `babynames` a bit. How many rows, columns does it have? How many unique names?

```{r}
library(babynames)
babynames
```


Summarizing babynames
========================================================

What does this calculate?

```{r}
babynames %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarise(prop = max(prop), 
            name = name[which.max(prop)])
```


Summarizing babynames
========================================================

Hands-on: the `babynames` dataset
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: false

Load the dataset using `library(babynames)`.

Read its help page. Look at its structure (rows, columns, summary).

Use `dplyr` to calculate the total number of names in the SSA database for each year. Hint: `n()`.

Make a graph or table showing how popular YOUR name has been over time (either its proportion, or rank).


Summarizing babynames
========================================================

```{r, eval=FALSE}
babynames %>% 
  filter(name == "Benjamin") %>% 
  qplot(year, n, color = sex, data = .)

babynames %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(name == "Benjamin") %>% 
  qplot(year, rank, color = sex, data = .)
```


Summarizing babynames
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
babynames %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Benjamin", "Rachel")) %>% 
  qplot(year, rank, color = name, shape = sex, data = ., main = "Benjamin and Rachel")
```


Important things we didn't talk about
========================================================

- getting your data _into_ R
- working with non-text/tabular data
- lists
- joins (merging datasets)
- handling dates and timestamps
- plotting (though we had many examples)

But the tools we've covered here can do a lot!


Split-apply-combine: Max
========================================================

Compute relative growth for each treatment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tree_diameter_data %>%
  # Each day's diameter is in a separate column. Reshape
  gather(date, diameter, -treatment) %>% 
  
  # Make sure the data are in chronological order
  arrange(date) %>% 
  
  # For each tree, compute growth from beginning of the season
  group_by(tree_id) %>% 
  mutate(growth = diameter - first(diameter)) %>% 
  
  # For each treatment and species, 
  # compute average growth over all trees
  group_by(treatment, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth)) ->
  
  tree_growth_by_trt
```


Split-apply-combine: Kayla
========================================================

How does the spatial variability of soil respiration evolve over time?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
licor_sr_data %>% 
  # Select the columns we're interested in
  select(date, flux, collar_number, t10, sm) %>% 
  
  # We are fundamentally interested in treatment; use a 'join'
  # to pull in that information from a table of collars/treatments
  left_join(collar_treatments, by = "collar_number") %>% 
  
  # Compute variability between collars by month and treatment
  group_by(month(date), treatment) %>% 
  summarise(spatial_variability = sd(flux) / mean(flux)) ->
  
  tree_growth_by_trt
```


Split-apply-combine: Lisa
========================================================

Calculate canopy and subcanopy assimilation for aspen in three size classes, weighting appropriately.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
licor_leaf_data %>%
  # We only have a tree number; pull in complete information
  left_join(tree_database, by = "tree_number") %>% 
  
  filter(species == "POGR") %>% 
  
  # Split the trees into small, medium, big
  mutate(size_class = cut(dbh, breaks = 3)) %>% 
  
  # We want to weight the computation by leaf area, which scales
  # nonlinearly with diameter
  group_by(size_class, canopy_position) %>% 
  summarise(flux = weighted.mean(flux, w = dbh ^ 2)) ->
  
  leaf_assimilation
```
